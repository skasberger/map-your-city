* REQUIREMENTS
Develop a location based game for the Location-based Service Course, which is useful for the Open Street Map community worldwide.
Purpose is, to validate different geoobject categories and their attributes
- make fun
- interactive gamedesign
- use social components like reputation, web2.0
- use location based data
- use open government data from austria (for APPS4Austria challenge)
- use Open Street Map data
- useful for open street map
- document and do in an open science way
- document everything in english
- build the software and the user participation so it is mainly selforganized and driven by the openstreetmap community
- have the rights on the data and announce publication of it in accumulated way later on
** GAME MODI
- special points for completing objects or validating bugs http://keepright.ipax.at/report_map.php?zoom=14&lat=48.20808&lon=16.37221
- balance between long term and short term incentives
- report bugs in game and openstreetmap

# ideas
- spy: user or team can see all other users/team
- invisibility: user is invisible against spy
- freeze: user/team is not allowed to move => points punishment
- punish other players or teams with minus points

*** SINGLE PLAYER
**** FREE FOR ALL 
needs better naming
change settings in game 

Everyone can validate geoobjects based on different settings
- category
- missing attributes
- area: radius (own position or fixed), district if available
- actualization
**** MAPPER OF THE WEEK
Every week a different object category must be validated and there can be only one winner for it.
You get a message every week for your new quest.
One Week per month is enough => predefine cause of holidays, exame times and so on => for every region different
**** RANDOM 
generate list of user chosen number of geoobjects in an choosen area.
i.e.: 100 Restaurants in graz 
*** MULTI PLAYER
Free setup based on
- category
- area: administrative, radius (own position or fixed)

# mechanisms
- startpoint of one team is the endpoint of another
- team check in via buffer
- show/hide players on the map
- staged check in of points: first check in 2 points, seconde check in of member of same team 5 points
- slow down game so no accidents happen

**** IDEA
- give every team 

**** DONT KNOW THE NAME
Give every team a certain amount of objects. If you check out another object, you will get more points, than you get when you check out your own already owned object.
**** MAPPER OF THE WEEK
