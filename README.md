map-your-city
=============

This is a location based game in and for open street map, where you can validate selected geoobjects in a game environment.

This project is part of the location based service course on the Technical University of Graz during WS2012.

The simple microblog app for flask set up on heroku with Sqlalchemy and postgres db.  
This isn't anything ground breaking but I was having some fun with it and decided to keept it around
for reference.
